# About Me

## My Hobbies
- Studying mathematics, primarily *Calculus II* & *linear algebra* in recent times :books:
- Questioning the *why's* of certain math topics while standing in front of a whiteboard and making little progress to understanding it :closed_book:
- Drawing using pens, sharpies, and pencils :pencil:
- Playing around using the online Desmos calculator to make interesting animations :paintbrush:
- Running, usually **5 kilometers** :athletic_shoe:
- Napping, it feels somewhat relaxing momentarily but it's met with regret after I wake up :sleeping:
- Weightlifting, even though my looks make that sound like a sad joke :sweat_smile:
- Drinking tea derivied from low quality store bought tea bags :tea:

## My Random Opinions
- I dislike reading lengthy fictional books :book:
- Fortune cookies taste *wonderful* :fortune_cookie:
- I despise French classes (and any language studies for that matter) even though they're relatively easy ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·
- Sleeping with your socks on isn't ***that*** bad aslong as your socks are clean :socks:
- Wrigley's Doublemint gum tastes like a steamy pile of garbage and it leaves an even worse aftertaste ðŸ¤®
- White-colored lighting instantly makes any room look sickening :bulb:

## My Average Weekend
| 14:30 - 15:00 | 15:00 - 15:30 | 15:30 - 17:00 | 17:00 - 17:30 | 17:30 - 19:00 | 19:00 - 20:00 | 20:00 - 20:45 | 20:45 - 2:50 | 2:50 - 3:00 |

| Wake up, look at the time, feel like sâ– â– â– t :thumbsup: | "*Morning*" routine | Study or catch up on assignments, note that procrastination isn't infrequent | Dinner | Study or catch up on assignments | Workout | Eat and shower |  Study or catch up on assignments, again | Brush my teeth and go to bed |


## Struggles I'm facing
  - Procrastination, I often try and combat this with the "*5 second rule*", with varying success
  - Inferiority complex, I'm not sure how to fix this one, it feels awful
  - Organization, I often leave my belongings in disarray
  - A lack of social skills, having friends with common interests and good habits would make going to school more meaningful 
  - Horrendous sleep schedule, I'm still trying my best not to sleep 13 hours on the weekends (to clarify, I don't enjoy the extra sleep either)
  - Venting my problems in inappropriate places, *oh wait*
